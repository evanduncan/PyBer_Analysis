# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to practice taking data from a source rideshare service and create an analysis of the service that highlighted trends based on city size. The goal of the project was to produce a report showing a summary dataframe of the rideshare data and a line chart showing total fareas for each city type.

## Results

We see that the majority of rides, drivers, and total fares are accumulated in the urban cities with rural areas composing a small minority of all of these as well.

However, we can also see that average fare has the opposite trend as rural areas have the highest average fares and urban areas have the lowest.

## Summary

Based on these results, it is my recommendation that the CEO make adjustments to the service in order to alleviate concerning trends in the data. I would recommend incentivizing drivers to leave cities and enter the suburbs to accomodate demand. I also would recommend some kind of cap on the fares of short rides in rural areas as the high fares are prohibitive to business. Lastly, I would recommend some incentive to attract new drivers in rural and suburban areas as the driver count in those cities are low.
